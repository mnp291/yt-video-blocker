# Deprecated

Use new uBlock features instead of a new addon. For example :

`youtube.com##[class*=video-renderer]:has-text(/celal şengör|jahrein/iu)`


<del># Youtube Video Blocker </del>

It's yet another video blocker for Firefox but a working one! It is listed at :

~~https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-video-blocker/~~

Lemonrice's video blocker is not working for Firefox anymore. It has not much functionality as Lemonrice's but it is ok. You can define keywords with regex.

# Examples

To block : Adnan Oktar
    
To add : Adnan Oktar

---

To block : Jahrein

To add : jahrein  // No need to put ignore case flag. Extension has already.


---

Also, feel free to use regular expressions
